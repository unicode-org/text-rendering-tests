<h3 id="GSUB-3">GSUB-3: Substituting a Billion Laughs</h3>

<div class="desc">
  The <a href="../fonts/TestGSUBThree.ttf">font</a> for this
  test case is an OpenType version of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion
  laughs attack</a>. Its <em>GSUB</em> table contains a sequence of
  nine identical lookups. Each lookup replaces the glyph <em>o</em> by
  the string <em>olo</em>, provided that the <em>o</em> is surrounded
  (both preceded and followed) by an <em>l</em>. The first lookup
  thus expands one single laugh <em>(lol)</em> into ten. The second lookup
  gives 100 laughs; the third 1000; the fourth 10,000; the fifth
  100,000; and so forth.
  After executing the ninth lookup, the final result would be
  a billion laughs, but this takes a very long time (and
  large amounts of memory) to compute. If your implementation
  is immune to this attack, it should neither crash nor hang
  when rendering <em>lol</em> with this font. Instead, your
  implementation should stop executing once its internal
  buffer has reached a size limit.
